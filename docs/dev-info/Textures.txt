Textures for IcyCraft are most easily made using TileMapE-v2
Just make a tileset in TileMapE-v2 and call it "ICYtxp00"

If you would like to use another software to make the tileset, make sure that the sprites are 8x8 and 66 bytes long each,
formatted as: X size, Y size, x*y pixels.
Otherwise IcyCraft will not work as expected.
